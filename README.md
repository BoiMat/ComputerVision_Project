# ComputerVision_Project: Camera Calibration with Zhang's method

Camera calibration is an important task in computer vision and image processing,
as it allows to determine the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a
camera from a set of observed images. The intrinsic parameters include the focal
length, principal point, and distortion coefficients. The extrinsic parameters
include the position and orientation of the camera in the world coordinate system.
One widely used method for camera calibration is Zhang’s method, which
uses a checkerboard pattern to determine the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters
of the camera. The goal of this report is to implement and evaluate the performance
of Zhang’s method for camera calibration using a set of observed images
and compare the results with and without radial distortion correction.
